A* Search Algorithm Pseudocode:

Create a fringe that is a PriorityQueue<AStarNode> (comparing the 'f');
Create a list of visited nodes;
add default AStarNode;
while (fringe is not empty){
	aStarNode  = fringe.poll();
	currentNode = get the current node from the aStarNode;
	previousNode = get the previous node from the aStarNode;
	if (currentNode is not visited){
		set it to visited;
		add it to visited nodes;
		set the currentNode's previous field to previousNode;
		if (currentNode == destination node){
			break;
		}

		for (Segments = currentNode.segments){
			find the start and end nodes of the segment;
			if (end node is not visited){
				calculate new g value;
				calculate new f value;
				add it to the fringe;
			}
		}
	}
}

Create a new collection of segments;
for(currentNode in aStarNode; if it's previous != null; set it to its previous){
	for(Segement in currentNode.segments){
		add each segment into the collection and keep traversing through the 'previous' field of the nodes;
	}
}

Set all the visited nodes to unvisited;
Return the collection of segments;
